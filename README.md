# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Precedence Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive.  The problem arises from the order of CSS rule application, where styles applied through `@apply` can unintentionally override more specific styles defined later.

## Problem

When a class uses `@apply` to merge multiple other classes, and you then try to modify these styles on a specific element using more precise selectors, the `@apply` styles might take precedence, resulting in unexpected visual behavior.  This is because `@apply` essentially inlines the CSS at compile time, making it difficult to override afterward.

## Solution

To rectify this, you have several options:

1. **Avoid `@apply` for complex scenarios:** Use explicit classes in your styles instead of `@apply` if you need granular control over overrides.

2. **Use the `!important` flag:** While not ideal, you can use the `!important` flag to forcefully override the `@apply` styles.  However, this is discouraged, as it can make your CSS harder to maintain.

3. **Refactor your classes:** Carefully examine your classes and rearrange them to maintain the desired precedence.

4. **Use a more specific selector:** Ensure your overrides use more specific selectors (e.g., use IDs or element selectors) to guarantee they are applied correctly.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in `bug.css` and `bugSolution.css` to observe the problem and the proposed solutions.
