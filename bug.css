This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The problem stems from the way Tailwind generates its CSS, particularly when using `@apply` directives.  If you have a class like `.btn` that uses `@apply` to apply multiple other classes, and then you try to overwrite those classes on a specific instance, the styles from `@apply` can take precedence.

```javascript
// Styles.css
.btn {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded;
}

.btn-modified {
  @apply bg-red-500;
}
```

In this case, the `.btn-modified` will likely still have the `text-white` and `rounded` styles applied from the `.btn` class, overriding your `bg-red-500` change, which may not be what you expect.
