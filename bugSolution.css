One solution is to avoid using `@apply` for styles that you anticipate needing to override. Instead, explicitly define the styles.

Another solution, though generally discouraged for maintainability, is to use the `!important` flag on the overriding styles. This ensures the specific styling takes precedence.

```css
/* Styles.css */
.btn {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 2px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.btn-modified {
  background-color: red !important;
}
```

The best approach, however, is to refactor your CSS to use more specific selectors or avoid the need for overrides altogether.

This improved solution provides more maintainable and predictable styling, eliminating the need for workarounds like `!important`.
